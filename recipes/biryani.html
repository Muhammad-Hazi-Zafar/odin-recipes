        <h2 class="allure">The Allure of Biryani: A Taste of Karachi</h2>
        <p>
           Biryani is more than just a dish; it’s a culinary celebration that blends flavors and cultures.
           Particularly in Karachi, biryani has become an iconic staple, combining basmati rice with marinated
           meat—usually chicken or mutton—enhanced by spices. High-quality basmati rice is essential, absorbing
           the rich flavors. In Karachi biryani, bold spices, green chilies, and even potatoes create a unique
           twist on the classic recipe, infusing each bite with depth and excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
           Serving biryani is a communal experience, especially in Karachi, where it’s often presented in large
           pots at gatherings. The vibrant saffron-stained rice alongside tender, spicy meat creates an inviting
           feast. Accompaniments like raita and chutney elevate the flavors, making it a sensory delight.
           More than just a meal, Karachi biryani embodies joy and connection, inviting laughter and stories as
           it unites people around the table.

            <dd>
                Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for
                30 minutes, then drain.
            </dd>
            <dt><ol start="3"><li><strong>Fry Onions:</strong></li></ol></dt>
            <dd>
               In a large pot, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown.
               Remove half for garnishing later.
            </dd>
            <dt><ol start="4"><li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong></li></ol></dt>
            <dd>In the same pot with the remaining onions, add the marinated chicken. Cook until the chicken is
                browned and cooked through (about 10-15 minutes).
            </dd>
            <dt><ol start="5"><li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong></li></ol></dt>
            <dd>
                In a separate pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add the whole spices (cardamom, cloves,
                cinnamon, bay leaves) and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it’s 70% cooked
                (it should still have a bite). Drain the rice.
            </dd>

            <dd>
                In the pot with the chicken, layer the partially cooked rice on top. Sprinkle the reserved fried
                onions, cilantro, mint, and saffron (if using). Drizzle a little ghee on top.
            </dd>
            <dt><ol start="7"><li><strong>Dum Cooking:</strong></li></ol></dt>
            <dd>
                Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat for 25-30 minutes, allowing the flavors
                to meld (you can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam).
            </dd>
            <dt><ol start="8"><li><strong>Serve:</strong></li></ol></dt>
            <dd>
