        <h2>Homemade Pizza!</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza is a delicious dish that has captured the hearts of food lovers worldwide. Its origins trace
            back to Naples, Italy, where it began as a simple flatbread topped with tomatoes, cheese, and fresh
            basil. Over the years, it has evolved into a culinary canvas, allowing for endless variations and
            toppings, from traditional options like pepperoni and mushrooms to gourmet choices such as arugula
            and truffle oil. The balance of a crispy crust, rich sauce, and melted cheese makes each slice a
            delightful experience.

            Beyond its flavors, pizza serves as a social centerpiece, often enjoyed during gatherings, parties,
            or casual meals with friends and family. Its convenience and shareability make it an ideal choice
            for any occasion, whether it's a quick weeknight dinner or a festive celebration. With numerous 
            tyles, including New York thin crust, Chicago deep dish, and Neapolitan wood-fired, pizza can cater
            to diverse tastes and preferences, ensuring that there’s a perfect slice for everyone.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the Dough:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes
                        until it becomes frothy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center
                        and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more flour until it 
                        becomes smooth and elastic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes. Place it in a lightly 
                        oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 
                        hours, or until doubled in size.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Preheat the Oven:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Shape the Pizza:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions for
                        two medium pizzas or leave it whole for one large pizza.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On a floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness. Transfer it to
                        a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add Toppings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spread a layer of pizza sauce over the base. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top,
                        then add your favorite toppings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drizzle a little olive oil over the top for added flavor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in
                        the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is
                        bubbly and slightly browned.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Serve:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Add fresh basil leaves if
                        desired, slice, and enjoy!
