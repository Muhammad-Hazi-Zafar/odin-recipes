        <h2>Steaming Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>Fried rice is a beloved dish originating from Chinese cuisine, known for its savory flavor and
            versatility. Made by stir-frying cooked rice with a mix of ingredients like vegetables, proteins
            (such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu), and seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, it transforms
            leftovers into a satisfying meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Celebrated for its adaptability, fried rice can be customized to suit various tastes and dietary
            preferences. Often garnished with green onions or sesame seeds, itâ€™s a convenient and delicious
            option, whether served as a main course or a side dish.
